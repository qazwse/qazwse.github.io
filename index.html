        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a UX designer and programmer who's had too much education, and continues to learn. Recently I've been learning React via the Fullstack online course, and I've realized that front-end programming isn't as terrible as I first thought.</p>

        <h2>Cineplex Mobile Site UX Project</h2>
        <p>Project was completed at Juno College. I had to research the current mobile and web process for purchasing tickets, as well as check out the kiosks.
            After doing some location scouting, as well as conducting some interviews to gauge how people feel about purchasing tickets, I chose to focus on the mobile purchasing flow. 
            Also, conducting a preliminary usability evaluation lead me to realize that there were some problems there.
        </p>
        <p>
            I repeatedly heard that users were uncertain that they were buying tickets for the correct day, and that it was not easy to compare different movies at different theatres.
            So I busted out the pencils and got to sketching. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I used these sketches to do some quick paper prototyping with classmates, to make sure I wasn't missing anything, before committing to a digital "paper prototype".
            This next round of testing is where it gets interesting, as some of the choices I made were not resonating with the people I was testing. And despite some initial frustration ("Maybe they just don't get it...") I remembered that this is the point of testing! I realized that I was making some things more confusing (not having sensible defaults for some of the fields, requiring the user to fill in extra info to get to where they need) that I tried to correct in my final prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall I'm happy with how it turned out. I feel like I learned a lot, especially with how to use sketch, and get through an entire research proposal, from ideation to prototyping.

        <h2>Mobile Game Usability Review</h2>
        <p>A project I did while interviewing for a previous job, I am proud of my work on this one. 
            I was tasked with doing a player evaluation (UX for game speech) for a mobile game. 
            I had to focus on the new player experience over the first 1-2 hours, and give my feedback.
